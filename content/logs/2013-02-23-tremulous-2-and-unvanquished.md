It looks like the folks over at [AAAGames][] have recently picked up one of my most 
played games when I was in high school, [Tremulous][]. It's basically a 
first-person shooter set in a space-like arena (usually, though there are 
some maps on the contrary), but the catch is that one team consists of 
aliens while the other consists of humans. The gameplay significantly 
differs between the two teams, and aliens are especially unique as they 
are unable to use weaponry (so humans primarily attack from range while 
aliens are melee). Tremulous also allows you to build structures to 
assist allies and impede opponents, which is where team strategies come 
into play.

The original developers of Tremulous have all but stopped development on 
this game. Due to this, the playerbase has stagnated significantly. A few 
groups have picked up where they basically left off and started developing 
new games like [Unvanquished][] and TremZ. TremZ seems to have fallen off 
the face of the planet now, though, without a release.

Unvanquished is still in alpha, but it is playable and has gained popularity 
lately. It's runs on the Daemon engine, developed in house as a Quake 3 
engine with XreaL features. New models were introduced, and you can also 
play against AI. It remains open source and moddable. [Their forum][] is 
pretty active.

AAAGames have also started developing [Tremulous 2][]. It looks like they 
will be recreating it from scratch on Unreal Engine 3 (the original uses 
ioquake3), with new artwork. It appears, though, that Tremulous 2 will 
not be open source or free to play. That personally puts me off from 
the game, since it basically removes the chance of porting the [KoRx][] 
mod to Tremulous 2. They also are not going to support Linux, which in 
itself is a seriously bad move considering the Tremulous playerbase 
consisted of several Linux users. If you're interested in contributing to 
it, they have started a [Kickstarter campaign][] to raise money. That page 
is also pretty lengthy about what they're planning to make.

So, to recap, here are the differences between the two:

* UV is open source, while Trem2 is not.
* Both will be using different models
* Trem2 claims to be like the original (physics and balance wise I believe), 
UV has made changes where needed. I haven't seen how Trem2 is pulling this off
specifically, since it looks pretty different from the original.
* UV uses a combination of ioquake3 and XreaL, Trem2 uses Unreal Engine 3
* Trem2 does not support Linux.
* UV is free to play, Trem2 is not.
* UV is moddable, Trem2 lets you mod skins but not the gameplay.
* UV has a release already. Trem2 has an estimated release timeframe of Q4 2014.
* Trem2 has an in-game shop that handles real money for user-created mods, amongst other things.
