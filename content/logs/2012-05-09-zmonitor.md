I've spent the past few weeks working on a decent-sized project called 
[ZMonitor][] to help at my current job. It is basically a client I developed 
in Ruby to show the Zabbix dashboard in a terminal, since there wasn't one 
available previously (other than this perl+curl mashup my workplace was 
using).

The main application basically calls the API twice through JSON calls to 
gather all of the information it needs, and then generates an array of 
strings and prints them at the end. There is an option to hide events that 
are in maintenance mode, which can help a lot from spamming you with an 
unusable list.

The acknowledgement function can accept most regular expressions to allow 
for mass acknowledgement (however, no wildcards since those can be abused too 
easily).

There are several TODOs for this application already, too, that I might not 
get to complete anytime soon. The major one is to use ncurses for rendering 
the dashboard, and quite a bit of functionality will come with that (such as 
acknowledging from the dashboard, and maybe interactive filtering). 
Additional functions for showing the history of a server is also planned, 
and a calibration function to determine time differences between the local 
computer and Zabbix master.

1.0.9.pre is for the most part very usable now. I personally think some of 
the code is a bit ugly since I'm not superb at Ruby yet, so all input is 
welcome. The whole application is also pretty colourful, don't you think?
