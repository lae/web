This weekend was pretty productive for me. I've set up Postfix and Dovecot 
both on this server so now I'm serving mail from @milkteafuzz.com (primarily 
because I wanted to send texts/email from my server itself). I've also now 
configured my IRC client to send me texts whenever I'm away and highlighted 
or messaged, following [Michael Lustfield's][] [Irssi to SMS][] article for 
the most part.

In addition to the kyoto.maidlab.jp (see [my previous post][]), I've moved 
my DNS to [afraid.org's][] nameservers for milkteafuzz.com, and currently 
in the process of transferring clkwkornj.com to [NearlyFreeSpeech][] (I've 
used them for about 5 years now - they're great) and will be hosting its 
DNS on afraid.org, also.

I am set to move to Chicago in about a month (and consequently leaving my job, 
sadly) and once I do I'll probably start setting things up out of my apartment. 
My friend's started up a [survival minecraft server][] at [Knights of Reason][] 
but hasn't set up a creative server. I might end up making one. *Might.*

[Zmonitor 1.0.11][] has also been released and is now available from the repo 
at [rubygems.org][], so you can just run `gem install zmonitor`. 1.0.12 is 
probably rolling out soon but I won't make an announcement for it until the 
next major update, and hopefully it will be some sort of an interactive shell 
to work from.

Seeing how pretty I made kyoto.maidlab.jp I'm a bit inspired to redesign this 
site, so I might do that sometime soon. For now though, time to sleep. Possibly.
