## Overview

I am a 20 year old systems administrator and server firefighter aspiring to 
become both a developer and administrator. I learn very quickly in action and am 
not afraid to take on new ventures. I enjoy what I do and hope to someday create 
and maintain world-changing applications.

## Work Experience

### [HostGator.Com, LLC][], Austin, TX

#### Systems Administrator - June 2011 to present

I resolved hundreds of issues per week through our ticket system across thousands 
of servers. These ranged from common MySQL issues, backups and restorations, and 
reboot triage to web server/database tuning, major software upgrades and custom 
installations, filing bug reports, writing documentation, etc.

**Highlight**: I was employee of the month for November 2011 (5th month at the 
job/out of ~120 admins).

#### Systems Monitoring - December 2011 to present

As one unit of a small team of monitors (3-4 usually), I proactively monitor the 
entire shared server portion of our farm (over 4500 servers) for issues before 
they become major. Issues I handle range from CPU abuse, low disk space, and 
hard drive errors to Denial of Service attacks/flooding, disaster recovery, and 
individual site performance reviews. I also make public announcements on our 
[network status forums][] for extended downtime issues.

**Highlight**: I provided significant assistance in migrating the architecture 
of our shared/reseller servers from 32-bit to 64-bit.

## Projects

### [ZMonitor][]

This is a console client for Zabbix that I developed in Ruby, as the Zabbix 
monitoring software did not come bundled with one. It contacts the API (json) 
and generates a dashboard-like interface to show current active problems, their 
acknowledgement status and priority. This client also allows acknowledgement 
of active triggers, and other features like server history are underway.
