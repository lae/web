## Overview

I am a 20 year old systems administrator and server firefighter aspiring to become a developer. I learn very quickly in action and am not afraid to take on new ventures. I enjoy what I do and hope to someday create and maintain world changing applications.

## Work Experience

### [HostGator.Com, LLC][], Austin, TX

#### Systems Administrator - June 2011 to present

Part of a large team of administrators, we resolve thousands of issues per day, as a popular web host, across thousands of shared servers, virtual private servers and dedicated servers. These range from common database issues, backups and restorations, and reboot triage to web server/database tuning, major software upgrades and custom installations, filing bug reports and more.

*Highlight*: I was employee of the month for November 2011 (5th month at the job/out of ~120 admins).

#### Systems Monitoring - December 2011 to present

As one unit of a small team of monitors (3-4 usually), we proactively monitor the entire farm for issues before they become major. Issues I handle range from CPU abusers, low disk space, and hard drive errors to Denial of Service attacks/flooding, disaster recovery, and individual site performance reviews. Occasionally I do get to make public announcements on our [network status forums][].

## Volunteer Experience

### [The Bike Project of Urbana-Champaign][] - August 2010 to February 2011

#### Bike Mechanic

Assisted visitors to the on-campus shop with maintaining and building bicycles, and created the sister [Registered Student Organisation][] on campus as the president.

#### Technologist

Repurposed two decade-old computers to use around the shop/help business flow in the organisation. Also managed membership information and helped to create a scalable membership system.

## Skills

My major area of expertise is the GNU/Linux operating system and administration of it - this ranges with great knowledge in Arch/Gentoo Linux and CentOS, to experience in Red Hat's counterpart, Fedora, and Debian.

Other areas of working knowledge fall in: (X)HTML, CSS, PHP, bash scripting, SQL (sqlite/mysql), Lighttpd/Apache, cPanel/WHM, Plesk, Javascript, djbdns/BIND9, Exim, and LaTeX.

## Education

### [JASGA Language School][] - September to December 2011 (Austin, TX)

- Studied beginner III Japanese (continuation from college) in small classes, proficient in kana and many basic grammatical structures.

### [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][]

- Student in East Asian Languages and Cultures - Fall 2010 to Spring 2011  
  3.0 in-department GPA, advisor: Misumi Sadler
- Student in Computer Science - Spring 2011  
  4.0 in-department GPA, advisor: Stephen Herzog

### [Grand Prairie High School][] - August 2006 to June 2010

- Graduated Summa Cum Laude, 4.4 GPA

## Projects

### [Project Himari][] - January 2011 (on hold)

This is a project I'm working on (in Ruby) as a way to simply maintain a shared hosting environment suitable for Rails applications. Currently on hold as I do more research and learning.

### [Knights of Reason][] - March 2008 and ongoing

I assisted with website development, submitted a single C patch for a bug in the Tremulous mod, and moderated the servers and forum.

### spelling.php - Winter/Spring 2010

This was a small database backed application written in PHP that helped members of my spelling team practice for competitions - sounds and definitions were pulled from American Heritage's Online Dictionary.
