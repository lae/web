## Overview

I am a 20 year old systems administrator and server firefighter aspiring to 
become both a developer and administrator. I learn very quickly in action and am 
not afraid to take on new ventures. I enjoy what I do and hope to someday create 
and maintain world changing applications.

## Work Experience

### [HostGator.Com, LLC][], Austin, TX

#### Systems Administrator - June 2011 to present

Part of a large team of administrators, we resolve thousands of issues per day, 
as a popular web host, across thousands of shared servers, virtual private 
servers and dedicated servers. These range from common database issues, backups 
and restorations, and reboot triage to web server/database tuning, major 
software upgrades and custom installations, filing bug reports and more.

**Highlight**: I was employee of the month for November 2011 (5th month at the 
job/out of ~120 admins).

#### Systems Monitoring - December 2011 to present

As one unit of a small team of monitors (3-4 usually), we proactively monitor 
the entire farm (over 4500 servers) for issues before they become major. Issues 
I handle range from CPU abusers, low disk space, and hard drive errors to Denial 
of Service attacks/flooding, disaster recovery, and individual site performance 
reviews. I make public announcements on our [network status forums][] for 
extended downtime issues.
