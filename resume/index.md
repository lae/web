## Overview

I am a 20 year old systems administrator and server firefighter aspiring to 
become a developer. I learn very quickly in action and am not afraid to take on 
new ventures. I enjoy what I do and hope to someday create and maintain world 
changing applications.

## Work Experience

### [HostGator.Com, LLC][], Austin, TX

#### Systems Administrator - June 2011 to present

Part of a large team of administrators, we resolve thousands of issues per day, 
as a popular web host, across thousands of shared servers, virtual private 
servers and dedicated servers. These range from common database issues, backups 
and restorations, and reboot triage to web server/database tuning, major 
software upgrades and custom installations, filing bug reports and more.

**Highlight**: I was employee of the month for November 2011 (5th month at the 
job/out of ~120 admins).

#### Systems Monitoring - December 2011 to present

As one unit of a small team of monitors (3-4 usually), we proactively monitor 
the entire farm for issues before they become major. Issues I handle range from 
CPU abusers, low disk space, and hard drive errors to Denial of Service 
attacks/flooding, disaster recovery, and individual site performance reviews. 
Occasionally I do get to make public announcements on our [network status 
forums][].
