For now I have \*.milkteafuzz.com and \*.teppel.in currently pointing to the same 
server and document root. Anyone who's visiting for anime.milkteafuzz.com or some 
other service I previously had on my other servers should expect to see those come 
back up in the coming weeks (possibly this weekend) while I spent some time toying 
around with nginx' configuration.

With that said, some other special surprises may be in store.
