So, over this weekend I've set up [kyoto.maidlab.jp][] to point to this 
server. I'm going to start using this virtual host for my own projects, I 
suppose. Right now, I've made a pretty front page in just a matter of 
minutes, and just today I've set up some form of a public upload site using 
restricted SSH. I've wrote a script to make the whole set-up and upload 
process not too difficult, but enough to prevent automated spam bots.

This is basically how I set it up and use it, though the instructions differ:

    [liliff@hicari ~]$ wget -qO - http://kyoto.maidlab.jp/kmjp.sh > ./bin/kmjp
    [liliff@hicari ~]$ chmod +x ./bin/kmjp
    [liliff@hicari ~]$ kmjp bin/kmjp 
    Downloading private key...
    Private key now stored at /home/liliff/.ssh/kmjp-upload.
    Uploading bin/kmjp...
    kmjp                                      100% 1419     1.4KB/s   00:00    
    Success! Uploaded file can be found at:
    http://kyoto.maidlab.jp/p/kmjp

Pretty neat, isn't it? I'm basically giving access to SCP for anyone for a 
particular folder on the server. The major flaw I have right now is that 
files may be overwritten, which is something I'll be looking into resolving 
server-side. It's also somewhat amusing how the script itself auto-updates 
should there be a change on the server's version of the script. Useful.

Update (9:17): It's been updated to use rsync instead of scp now, to get 
around the overwriting files issue.
