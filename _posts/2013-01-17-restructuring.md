I'm (finally) in the process of redesigning this site. The journal entries 
will probably be stashed into one corner of the site by then. Anyway, I've 
brought up the old site instead of leaving a never ending 503 page up. 
Some posts will be purged (mostly because they've become irrelevant) or 
rewritten - we're just going to have to wait and see, aren't we?

It's almost time to wave bye to Totoro....

Meanwhile, enjoy whatever it is that brought you here!
