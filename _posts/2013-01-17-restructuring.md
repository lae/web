Update 2/15:

This site received it's makeover for the most part. I'm going to be 
spending the next few days still making changes to the style of certain 
elements and other things (the code snippets specifically come to mind). 
If you have suggestions, feel free to [email me](/contact).

There are a few items on my backlog for new articles, so I'll be working 
on those soon. I should also probably start looking for a job....

*Previously, on Milk Tea Fuzz:*

I'm (finally) in the process of redesigning this site. The journal entries 
will probably be stashed into one corner of the site by then. Anyway, I've 
brought up the old site instead of leaving a never ending 503 page up. 
Some posts will be purged (mostly because they've become irrelevant) or 
rewritten - we're just going to have to wait and see, aren't we?

It's almost time to wave bye to Totoro....

Meanwhile, enjoy whatever it is that brought you here!
