And there you have it.

As a present, here's an illustration of [Japan National Route 20][] from 
the promotional video of [言の葉の庭][] (The Garden of Words). It's a new film 
directed by Makoto Shinkai scheduled to air in theaters (Japan only, though) 
on 31 May. Feel free to use this as your wallpaper.

In other news, I open-sourced my [Showtimes][] app a few weeks ago. 
You can see it in action at [Commie Subs][].

I'll just sit here and continue to stare at the Raspberry Pi I recieved last 
year but still have yet to use for anything.
