Hi, my name is Musee. I'm currently a systems administrator who's actually 
looking to go into ruby development.

So, this place will be my corner of the internet to store what I create and 
find out, along with my thoughts. I hope it's helpful for someone out there.

Tomorrow's the blackout day. I wonder if people will remember this and what 
they would think. Down with SOPA!

This site isn't much now, but stay tuned!
