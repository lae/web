Per request by a old fellow KoR member, I've set up a tremulous 1.2 server at
nia.teppel.in:30720. You should be able to connect normally with Trem's client 
or Segfault. The server's name is KnightsOfReason.net since it seems my friend, 
with some support from Aaron (the main KoRx developer) wants me to have it be 
their official 1.2 server.

I'm going to look into possibly modifying a QVM, too. I can't go all 
full-fledged with porting KoRx to 1.2 (despite the huge want for it...) since I 
don't know C, and Aaron is both too busy with school and too lazy to port it 
himself, heh.
