Tah-dah! This site is now officially powered by [Jekyll][].

I did put this off for a few days, but all the content I had generated up to 
now was being created so that I all I really needed to do was get some layouts 
created for these posts and pages. It's really flexible, I can tell!

I will be writing some articles on Jekyll seeing as it's not very simple to 
delve in if you're not already familiar with it (it took me the entire day to 
push this out) both for my reference and for others who might have trouble. 
There doesn't really seem to be a lot of documentation with setting up a Jekyll 
site on the internet yet, so hopefully this will come in handy.

Update: Just pushed an initial commit for [this site's source at Github][].
