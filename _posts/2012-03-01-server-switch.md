So, yesterday I had my first dedicated server provisioned, and I've been tinkering 
with it since then, getting it configured as nicely as I can, with LVM and all sorts 
of funky things.

This site has now moved to the new server~ The domain is still currently pointing 
to the old server, and the old server is actually proxying requests to the Jekyll 
daemon on the new server for the time being, until I get the rest all migrated over. 

I'm also going to be working on getting a TremZ server online later - was 
intending to have it up by now but I guess I delayed myself a little with getting 
the actual dedicated server. Got a good deal though, through Vee from [DediDirect][]!
